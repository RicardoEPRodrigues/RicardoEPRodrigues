### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an [OpenGL Game Engine](https://github.com/RicardoEPRodrigues/3Engine) for teaching/learning purposes.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning game development using Unreal Engine.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with a [Linux Driver for the Magic Mouse 2](https://github.com/RicardoEPRodrigues/Linux-Magic-Trackpad-2-Driver). If you have knowledge and want to help reach out!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Linux, Videogames, Game Design, and traveling!

ðŸ“« You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Quenestil), [Email](mailto:ricardo.e.p.rodrigues@gmail.com), and follow me on [itch.io](https://quenestil.itch.io/).

âš¡ Fun fact: Quenestil, my nickname on several platforms, come from a Portuguese fantasy book series named CrÃ³nicas de Allaryia.
